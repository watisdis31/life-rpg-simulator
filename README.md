# 🧙‍♂️ Life RPG  
*Turn your daily life into a poorly-balanced RPG.*

Welcome to **Life RPG**, where:
- Cleaning your room gives EXP
- Forgetting to do anything makes the game judge you
- Productivity is optional, consequences are not

This is a **gamified life tracker** inspired by classic RPGs and the feeling of *“I should probably do something today”*.

## 🎮 How This Game Works

You are a **Player**.  
Your real-life actions = **quests**.  
Completing quests = **EXP**.  
EXP = **levels, badges, and questionable titles**.

No ads.  
No pay-to-win.  
No microtransactions.  
Just vibes and mild guilt.

---

## 📜 Daily Quests

Every day, you get a list of **daily quests**, such as:
- Clean your room
- Drink water
- Touch grass (indirectly)
- Do actual work (wild concept)

Click a quest → get EXP → neuron activation.

### When all quests are completed:
You’ll see:
> *“No quests today — enjoy your free time! 🌱”*

Which is the game politely telling you:
> “Go outside. You earned it.”

---

## ⏰ Daily Reset (⚠️ IMPORTANT, READ OR SUFFER)

Daily quests reset at **midnight (your local time)**.

### HOWEVER 🧠💥

For the **most reliable reset**, it is **recommended to:**

✅ **Close and re-open the website** after midnight  

Why?

- Browsers love pausing timers
- Background tabs are lazy
- JavaScript does not respect sleep schedules

Refreshing *usually* works,  
but **close + reopen = guaranteed fresh day**.

> Think of it like saving at a Pokémon Center before a new day.

---

## 📈 EXP & Leveling

- Every quest gives EXP
- Levels never reset
- Regret does

If you somehow have max EXP bar and don’t level up:
- Refresh
- Re-open
- Or stare at the screen threateningly (optional)

## 🏅 Badges (a.k.a. The Game Judging You)

You earn badges automatically based on behavior:

### 🟢 Productive Today  
You did *something*. Congrats.

### 🦥 Lazy Day  
You did *nothing*. The game noticed.

### 🔥 Grinder  
You gained **100+ EXP in a single week**.  
The game is slightly impressed.

### 😴 Missed a Day  
You were inactive yesterday.  
No anger. Just disappointment.

### 💀 Missed 3 Days in a Row  
You vanished.  
The game assumes you are either:
- Busy
- Or touching way too much grass

---

## 🔥 Streak System (Fear-Based Motivation)

The game tracks **consecutive active days**.

### Streak Badges:
- 🔥 **X-Day Streak**
- 💎 **X-Week Streak**
- 🌙 **X-Month Streak**
- 🏆 **X-Year Streak** (touching legendary status)

Miss a day → streak breaks  
Miss multiple days → emotional damage

---

## 🧠 Titles (Absolutely Serious RPG Titles)

Your title updates dynamically based on stats and vibes.

Examples:
- 🌱 Just Getting Started
- 🛌 Certified Bed Enjoyer
- 🏋️ I live for the EXP
- 📈 Min-Maxing Life Instead of Money
- ✨ Shiny Human (rare, don’t ask)
- 🛸 Not From This Planet (extremely rare, probably bugged)
- **AND MORE** (play it yourself to find out)

Titles are **semi-random**, slightly chaotic, and legally binding.

## 🖼 Avatar System

- Click your avatar to upload an image
- Automatically resized & cropped
- Stored safely
- Judged silently

You can also remove it and return to default blob mode.

---

## 🔐 Firebase Security Disclaimer (READ THIS)

This project uses **Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)**.

Yes, Firebase API keys exist in the frontend.  
That’s **normal and safe**.

Security is enforced through:
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore access rules
- Domain restrictions

So even if someone copies the key:
> They still get **nothing** 🎉

A few things to be very clear about:

- ✅ I **cannot** read or write other users’ data  
- ✅ You **cannot** read or write other users’ data  
- ❌ This app does **NOT** connect to **ANY** of your personal and important data
- ❌ No credit cards, no spying, no funny 
- **This is a personal project, not a bank**

I am not responsible if you accidentally give the internet admin access.

## 🧪 Known Quirks (a.k.a. Not Bugs, Just Personality)

- Daily reset works best when reopening the site
- Browser sleep can delay timers
- DevTools time-travel testing may confuse the app
- The game may roast you (emotionally)

---

## 🧡 Final Notes

This project is:
- A productivity tool
- A joke
- A coping mechanism
- A retro RPG fantasy
- Probably over-engineered

If it helps you do **one useful thing a day**,  
it has already succeeded.

Now go complete a quest. 🎮🌱
